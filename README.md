#How to use
- Configure `config.php` to ensure the application can connect to your database.
- Upload all the files to a php webserver.
- Navigate to `install.php` to setup the application. Example 
<http://202.118.249.4/~ausstu2/install.php>

- This application is useless at the moment. The install script simply deletes
all your tables and create a new table called `something`.
